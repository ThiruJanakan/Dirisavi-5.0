  What is Leo?
Leadership, Experience, and Opportunity define what it means to be a Leo. Leos represent the youth in our community, devoted young people who recognize the power of action. Together, Leos from various districts collaborate to create a strong partnership - one of mutual respect, where everyone learns from the innovative insights of past Leos, and gains access to the proven strategies of those who have successfully served the world for decades. Being a Leo is about leading by example, building relationships, and making a positive impact through acts of kindness. By becoming a Leo, individuals gain entry into a vast network of volunteers united in the common goal of effecting positive change.
